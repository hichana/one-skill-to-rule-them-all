# Security Tool Disclaimer

## No Guarantee of Detection

OSTRTA is a security analysis tool provided for **informational purposes only**. While OSTRTA employs multiple detection techniques to identify potentially malicious patterns in SKILL.md files, it **cannot guarantee** the detection of all malicious content, obfuscation techniques, or attack vectors.

Security is an evolving landscape, and attackers continuously develop new techniques to bypass detection systems.

## No Guarantee of Accuracy

OSTRTA's analysis may produce:
- **False positives**: Flagging benign content as potentially malicious
- **False negatives**: Missing malicious content that should have been detected

Results should be considered as **additional input** for your security assessment, not as a definitive verdict.

## Use at Your Own Risk

You assume all risk when:
- Installing or using any SKILL.md file analyzed by OSTRTA
- Relying on OSTRTA's analysis for security decisions
- Deploying systems based on OSTRTA's recommendations

**A "SAFE" verdict from OSTRTA is NOT a security certification.** It means OSTRTA did not detect known malicious patterns at the time of analysis.

## Not a Substitute for Professional Review

OSTRTA is not a replacement for:
- Professional security audits
- Manual code review by qualified security professionals
- Comprehensive penetration testing
- Formal security assessments

## Your Responsibility

As the user, you are responsible for:
- Reviewing OSTRTA's findings and evidence
- Making informed decisions about installing skills
- Understanding the risks of running untrusted code
- Implementing appropriate security controls (sandboxing, monitoring, etc.)

## Limitation of Liability

The authors and contributors of OSTRTA shall not be liable for any damages, data loss, security breaches, or other harm resulting from:
- Use of OSTRTA
- Reliance on OSTRTA's analysis
- Installation of skills analyzed by OSTRTA
- Decisions made based on OSTRTA's recommendations

## Changes and Updates

This disclaimer may be updated at any time. Continued use of OSTRTA constitutes acceptance of any changes.

## Legal Protections

OSTRTA is provided under the MIT License with NO WARRANTY. See LICENSE file for full legal terms.
